description: Route MimiClaw, ESP32, SGP30, and chat-driven hardware tasks to the right narrower skill. Use when the request spans MimiClaw architecture, ESP-IDF I2C bring-up, SGP30 air-quality sensing, or AI-callable GPIO/RGB tool design and Codex needs the right entry point first.

# MimiClaw ESP32 SGP30 Agent

Use this folder as a router, not as the main implementation guide.

## Route By Task

- Repo structure, startup flow, agent loop, channels, memory, or deciding where a change belongs:
  read [`../mimiclaw-agent-architecture/SKILL.md`](../mimiclaw-agent-architecture/SKILL.md).
- ESP32 I2C wiring, pin choice, pull-ups, probe failures, or ESP-IDF v5 bus/device API details:
  read [`../esp32-idf-i2c-bringup/SKILL.md`](../esp32-idf-i2c-bringup/SKILL.md).
- SGP30 command flow, CRC, warm-up, baseline persistence, humidity compensation, or air-quality semantics:
  read [`../sgp30-air-quality-integration/SKILL.md`](../sgp30-air-quality-integration/SKILL.md).
- Tool naming, chat-trigger friendliness, GPIO/RGB control, or adding high-level aliases such as `read_air_quality`:
  read [`../mimiclaw-hardware-tool-design/SKILL.md`](../mimiclaw-hardware-tool-design/SKILL.md).

## Cross-Cutting Defaults

- Treat this repo as an `ESP-IDF v5.5+` C/FreeRTOS firmware project.
- Prefer narrow, reliable tools over broad agent-side reasoning about hardware state.
- Prefer a high-level chat-facing tool name and keep the hardware-specific name as a lower-level alias.
- Validate hardware control through the serial CLI or direct tool execution before trusting chat automation.
- When working with SGP30, remember that `eCO2` is an algorithmic estimate and not a true NDIR CO2 measurement.

## Local Code Hotspots

- Current GPIO and WS2812 tools:
